# Grzegorz Dubiel

## Hi, I'm Grzegorz, full-stack developer (MERN) :smiley::wave:

I love creating new things by coding. I have always liked "front side" of the cyber world. I have been coding since march of 2020. Before, I've always been curious about how user interfaces work behind the scenes and how I can create them from a blank page in the code editor. I'm fascinated in React, before I met this library I have been coding in vanilla JS. When I started learning React I felt tons of possibilities. I'm a big fan of React hooks and functional programming. I like taking on difficult programming challenges. 

I am open to cooperation :handshake::handshake::handshake:
